**{doilinker}** allows you to link related DOIs.
Usually this is to find the published version of a preprint (or the reverse).
It does this by querying the Crossref database using **{rcrossref}** and matching DOIs using the method described by Cabanac, Oikonomidi and Boutron (see citation below).

## Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lazappi/doilinker")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(doilinker)
## basic example code
```

## Citation

If you use this package please cite the original publication for the linking method
(if you want to cite the package directly as well that would be great ðŸ˜‰ but crediting the original authors is the important part):
