**{doilinker}** allows you to link related DOIs.
Usually this is to find the published version of a preprint (or the reverse).
It does this by querying the Crossref database using **{rcrossref}** and matching DOIs using the method described by Cabanac, Oikonomidi and Boutron (see citation below).

Documentation for the package can be viewed at http://lazappi.github.io/doilinker.
