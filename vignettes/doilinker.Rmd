# Introduction

Ever wondered if your favourite preprint has been published or wanted to link a publication and a preprint for some reason?
Then **{doilinker}** can help!
It implements a method developed by Cabanac, Oikonomidi and Boutron to match preprints and publications using information retrieved from Crossref.

# Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lazappi/doilinker")
```

# Usage

First load the package.

```{r setup}
library(doilinker)
```

Then we can search for linked references.

```{r search}
results <- search_doi_links("10.1101/133173")
head(results)
```

The results contain information retrieved from Crossref.
Most of the columns are self-explanatory but a few to be aware of are:

* `score` - The query score returned by Crossref.
  Not used for matching but can be useful to check.
* `match` - Whether each result is a match according to the Cabanac, Oikonomidi and Boutron method

Please refer to the Crossref documentation for more details on the other fields.

## Parameters

By default all results from Crossref are returned but you can filter to only
matches by setting `filter_matches = TRUE`.
You can also change the number of results returned by setting the `limit` parameter.

## Citation

If you use this package please cite the original publication for the linking method
(if you want to cite the package directly as well that would be great ðŸ˜‰ but crediting the original authors is the important part):
